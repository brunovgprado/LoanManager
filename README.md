## Safety

All endpoints on Loan Manager are protected by authentication, so all requisitions need to have a Bearer token in the header.   
To make the authentication process more easy, Loan Manager have an integrated authentication service that uses JWT and provides endpoints to signup and signin.

## How to run the project

Loan manager is a Restfull API project that uses a docker based environment with a docker-compose file, so you just need docker running on your computer.   
So assuming you have docker running, you can push the commands below into your prompt terminal.

```
$ docker-compose build
```
```
$ docker-compose up
```
So voil√†! docker will up the API and the PostgreSql server, create the database, create and populate the tables and make the Loan manager API accessible at localhost:8000.  
You can look at http://localhost:8000/docs for endpoints description and make tests with swagger.
